Daily Based Morgan--Morgan--Finney (DMMF) Soil Erosion Model
}
\description{
Implements the daily based Morgan--Morgan--Finney (DMMF) soil erosion model for estimating surface runoff and sediments budgets from a field or a catchment on a daily basis.
}
\details{
This package is the implementation of the daily based Morgan--Morgan--Finney (DMMF) soil erosion model to estimate surface runoff and sediment budget of a field and a catchment on a daily basis.

The DMMF model is one of the variant of the widely used Morgan--Morgan--Finney soil erosion model and largely based on the modified MMF model with several modifications (see details in Choi et al. (2017)). 

This \R implementation of the DMMF model is suitable for estimating surface runoff and sediment budgets of fields or catchments represented by raster.

The package provides the \code{\link{DMMF}} function that estimates surface runoff and soil erosion using DMMF model, \code{\link{DMMF_Simple}} function which is the simpler version of the \code{\link{DMMF}} and \code{\link{SinkFill}} function that generates sink free map for the DMMF model based on the sink fill algorithm from Wang and Liu (2006) and the SAGA-GIS module of ``Module Fill Sinks (Wang \& Liu)'' by Volker Wichmann (2007).
